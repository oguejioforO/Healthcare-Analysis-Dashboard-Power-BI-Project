
#  Healthcare Analysis Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project

##  Project Overview

This analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare by visualizing
trends in patient conditions, cost distribution, hospital admissions, and more.

## Dataset Info
- **Source**: Provided by CIEOS for the challenge
- **Total Records**: 55,501 unique patient entries 
- **Hospitals**: Data includes hospitals from multiple U.S. regions including Houston,
                Cleveland, and Los Angeles 
- **Key Fields**: Age, Gender, Blood Type, Diagnosed Conditions, Hospital Info, Insurance Provider, Admission Type, Treatment Cost,
                 Medications, Test Results, etc.

## Analysis Objectives

1. Identify the most common demographics (age, gender, blood type)
2. Determine the most frequently diagnosed medical conditions
3. Analyze hospital admission types and lengths of stay
4. Examine treatment costs by condition, hospital, and insurance
5. Track medication usage trends across hospitals
6. Evaluate test results and patient outcomes
7. Highlight regional differences in healthcare performance

## Visualizations

- Bar and Column Charts (Cost per Condition, Blood type)
- Line chart(Monthly Admissions Trend)
- Stacked bar Chart (Test Results, and medications per condition)
- Map Visual (Regional hospital performance)
- Pie Charts (Gender, Insurance, Admission Types)
- KPI Cards (Total Patient, Doctors, Total billing)

## Limitations
- Limited temporal data for multi-year trend analysis
---

## Recommendations

- Investigate regional anomalies (e.g., Houston)  
- Improve test result standardization  
- Analyze insurance billing discrepancies  
- Include outcome tracking for long-term analysis

---

## Conclusion

This dashboard gives stakeholders actionable insight into healthcare delivery, 
helping optimize treatment strategies, improve care quality, 
and manage costs more effectively.
